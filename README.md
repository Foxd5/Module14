# Module14
Read me for module 14 assignment. It contains the changes to the ball in penalty
kicker and changes in the brick breaker scene. There is also a screenshot
added to the development branch of the unity project.
I had to do quite a lot to get github desktop
and all of these other programs to work. Even just getting the files on Github
was a huge task, as not everything could be done in a single commit. Wasn't a
huge fan of the lack of direction, but hey, I digress. at least its over.
